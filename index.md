## Welcome to the microbial isolates analysis suite

The suite was developed as part of a collaborative project between [Volac International Ltd](https://www.volac.com/). and [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), partly funded by [Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) as part of a [knowledge transfer partnership (KTP)](https://www.ktp-uk.org/).

Explore bacterial genomes with:

[Core](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Core/): A comprehensive whole genome analysis pipeline for microbial isolates. 

[Tool 1](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_1/): The mass screening tool using up-to-date, curated databases 

[Tool 2](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_2/): A genome mass screening tool with bespoke sequences 

[Tool 3](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_3/): The whole genome comparison tool 

[Tool 4](https://amybaldwin.github.io/Tool_4/): Finding unique sections of DNA for primer design

The Tools are built with the pipeline manager [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), and operate within [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity) containers.

***NEW***, the [RunAnyTool](https://amybaldwin.github.io/RunAnyTool/) guide describes the quick and easy set up almost any software tool on your system. To use space efficiently, the tools can easily be removed once analysis is complete. Set up does not require installing additional dependencies and can be completed in a matter of minutes.
