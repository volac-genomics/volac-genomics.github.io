The Tools are built with the pipeline manager [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), and operate within [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity) containers.

The suite was developed as part of a collaborative project between [Volac International Ltd](https://www.volac.com/). and [Cardiff University](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/), partly funded by [Innovate UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk) as part of a [knowledge transfer partnership (KTP)](https://www.ktp-uk.org/).
